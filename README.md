- 👋 Hi, I’m @saamo.
<!---- 👀 I’m interested in programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently improving my skills in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)/[Go](https://go.dev) and IaC on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com).
- 💞️ ... So I could start contributing to some opensource projects again.
- 📫 How to reach me: `echo "hello" > /dev/null`--->
