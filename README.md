- 👋 Hi, I’m @saamo.
- 👀 I’m interested in web programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently improving my skills in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)/[Go](https://go.dev), cloud development on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) and [QWIK](https://qwik.builder.io)...
- 💞️ ... So I could start contributing to some opensource projects again.
